# A Cloud Computing Approach for Secure File Transfer 🚀🔐
This project demonstrates a secure, scalable, and cloud-based approach for file transfer using AWS services, Python, and Node.js. The system ensures end-to-end encryption, providing confidentiality and integrity while allowing users to securely transfer, store, and retrieve sensitive documents.

# 🌟 Key Features
End-to-End Encryption: Documents are encrypted using AES-256 encryption before transmission.
Cloud-Based Architecture: Leverages AWS S3, AWS Lambda, and API Gateway for secure and scalable storage and processing.
Multi-Language Development: Backend logic is implemented using Node.js and Python.
Automation & Monitoring: Tracks file transfers and monitors system performance using AWS CloudWatch.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
 
 - AWS S3	Secure cloud storage of encrypted files
 - AWS Lambda	On-demand serverless processing for uploads and encryption
 - AWS API Gateway	Secure API interface for file upload and retrieval
Python	Encryption, decryption, and monitoring scripts
Node.js	Backend server logic and API development
AES / Bcrypt	Encryption algorithms for secure data storage and transmission
CloudWatch	Monitoring system performance and logging errors

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and specify your AWS credentials:

ini
Copy
Edit
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
ENCRYPTION_SECRET=your_secret_key_for_encryption

Set up AWS CloudWatch to monitor logs.
🚀 Usage
Upload a File: Send a POST request to upload and encrypt the file.

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST "https://your-api-gateway-url/upload" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@path/to/your/file.pdf"
Retrieve a File: Send a GET request to decrypt and retrieve the file.

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X GET "https://your-api-gateway-url/download?filename=file.pdf"
Monitoring: Track file uploads and errors via CloudWatch.

✅ Project Highlights
Secure Transfer: Encrypts data locally before transmission, ensuring no unauthorized access.
Efficient Storage: Reliably stores encrypted files in AWS S3.
Scalable Architecture: Serverless design using AWS Lambda to scale without manual intervention.
Monitoring: Built-in logging ensures quick error resolution and performance optimization.
📊 Future Improvements
Integrate multi-region replication for improved availability and fault tolerance.
Add role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive files.
Build a web-based dashboard for tracking uploads and monitoring performance.
Expand support for public-key cryptography (RSA).
