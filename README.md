# A Cloud Computing Approach for Secure File Transfer üöÄüîê
This project demonstrates a secure, scalable, and cloud-based approach for file transfer using AWS services, Python, and Node.js. The system ensures end-to-end encryption, providing confidentiality and integrity while allowing users to securely transfer, store, and retrieve sensitive documents.

# üåü Key Features
End-to-End Encryption: Documents are encrypted using AES-256 encryption before transmission.
Cloud-Based Architecture: Leverages AWS S3, AWS Lambda, and API Gateway for secure and scalable storage and processing.
Multi-Language Development: Backend logic is implemented using Node.js and Python.
Automation & Monitoring: Tracks file transfers and monitors system performance using AWS CloudWatch.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
 
 - AWS S3	- Secure cloud storage of encrypted files
 - AWS Lambda	- On-demand serverless processing for uploads and encryption
 - AWS API Gateway -	Secure API interface for file upload and retrieval
 - Python	- Encryption, decryption, and monitoring scripts
 - Node.js	- Backend server logic and API development
 - AES / Bcrypt	- Encryption algorithms for secure data storage and transmission
 - CloudWatch	- Monitoring system performance and logging errors

# ‚úÖ Project Highlights
Secure Transfer: Encrypts data locally before transmission, ensuring no unauthorized access.
Efficient Storage: Reliably stores encrypted files in AWS S3.
Scalable Architecture: Serverless design using AWS Lambda to scale without manual intervention.
Monitoring: Built-in logging ensures quick error resolution and performance optimization.

# üìä Future Improvements
Integrate multi-region replication for improved availability and fault tolerance.
Add role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive files.
Build a web-based dashboard for tracking uploads and monitoring performance.
Expand support for public-key cryptography (RSA).
